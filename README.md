# A Note for 5G SUCI Profile A/B Scheme
As of 2023.05.14, for the setting of Home Network Public Key for 5G SUCI Profile A/B Scheme, the comment in [udm.yaml.in](https://github.com/open5gs/open5gs/blob/main/configs/open5gs/udm.yaml.in) of Open5GS is very helpful.
For free5GC, there are setting items in [udmcfg.yaml](https://github.com/free5gc/free5gc/blob/main/config/udmcfg.yaml).

In addition, [UERANSIM](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM) supported 5G SUCI Profile A Scheme on 2023.05.09.
UERANSIM can use 5G SUCI Profile A Scheme with Open5GS and free5GC.
